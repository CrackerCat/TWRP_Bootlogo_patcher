### Instructions:
   - Download TWRP_Bootlogo_patcher-*.zip from [releases](https://github.com/corsicanu/TWRP_Bootlogo_patcher/releases)
   - Boot phone in TWRP
   - Flash the downloaded zip as any other
   - Reboot and enjoy

### Further info:
   - If your **exynos** device is not present in the list above, create an [issue](https://github.com/corsicanu/TWRP_Bootlogo_patcher/issues) and tell me more about your device (Model number & possible model variations - F/FN/N/+/e/Ultra/Nfc and so on)
   - In case of reflashing modem/bootloader you will need to reflash this zip to nuke the warnings again (bootloader will overwrite the patch)
   - Any graphical glitch regarding the bootlogo, or any other exotic issue, will be fixed by reflashing bootloader of the specific software version you are running, however, in case you encounter any of those try to submit an [issue](https://github.com/corsicanu/TWRP_Bootlogo_patcher/issues) in which i'll try to assist in fixing

### Patch steps (for nerds):
   - get the device bootloader version from cmdline
   - if the bootloader version matches device list - proceed to patch
   - unpack tools and prepare folders
   - find up_param and param blocks and set them as variables
   - check up_param for [booting_warning.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PMDv38E.jpeg)
       - if booting_warning.jpg size is greater than 1byte then it means it's not patched
       - backup up_param to internal storage
       - copy normal splash logo over [svb_orange.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bQ9wTeW.jpeg)
       - echo "" (nothing) in booting_warning.jpg (which makes the size of the file 1byte)
       - repack up_param and flash back
   - check param for [booting_warning.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PMDv38E.jpeg)
       - if booting_warning.jpg size is greater than 1byte then it means it's not patched
       - backup param to internal storage
       - copy normal splash logo over [svb_orange.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bQ9wTeW.jpeg)
       - echo "" (nothing) in booting_warning.jpg (which makes the size of the file 1byte)
       - repack param and flash back

With these phone now will show a "nothing" logo and then show a warning containing the normal splash logo, which will make it look as normal and unrooted/locked bootloader. 

Yes, the warnings are not disabled, more like hidden, the phone will take same time as before to pass the splash screen but at least you won't have the hazard triangle which looks like it's soon going to explode (inb4 Note7, we will miss you).
